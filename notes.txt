// General Comments for the given code: 
1- You have a function called
public function __addInBOBPlayer($reqData, $returnData) ...,
It does not follow the template, I think the first parameter is missing ..... Please check
I did not include it in the switch case till you tell me that  it should be corrected

2- This function is defined as Public
public function __apieditABEPlayerUser ($iboreseller, $reqData, $returnData)
Should it be private so no one can access from outside?
Please check
By the way, I include it in the switch case

3- This function is Public
public function __apiEditBOBPlayerUser($bobPlayer, $reqData, $returnData)
Should it be private so no one can access from outside?
Please check
By the way, I include it in the switch case

Bellow is the generic code for a function that replaces all the 17 functions in your code


I called it __apiedit_App_General
I added a new parameter called $App_Name which should be like your 17 functions' name as     __apieditBOBProTV, __apieditIBOXXPlayer, ......
Once you pass the function name to this function, it will select the correct parameter according to switch case and implement the same code.
